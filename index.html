<!-- Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update aka how much money they have won or lost. Min bet does $5 and Max bet does $50. They should start with $1000. Matches of the three wheels = a win just like a normal slot machine and they win 10x their bet -->
