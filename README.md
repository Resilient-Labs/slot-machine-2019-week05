## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+

This app checks for items matching 3 in a row, using Math.random(). It was a more complex app than Rock, Paper, Scissors but it used similar functionality.

## Optimizations:

* Use setInterval() to create slot machine animations
* Add images to the site
* Style and add design

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to update the score when they win, despite the win function being in a different space than the function that knew how much they were betting. I learned how to add more items to randomize through. Unlike rps, the players bet a certain amount which then has to be reflected in their score if they won or lost that round. This was tricky with function scopes, but I found a way to make it happen.
