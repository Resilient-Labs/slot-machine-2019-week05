## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

Money Shores Slot Machine was a great way to apply some fundamental JavaScript concepts like variables, functions, and conditional statements. 

## Optimizations

The CSS could definitely be changed a bit and I look to do this in the future! 

## Reflections:

This was a fun project to create and test out! I personally took to conditionals more than some other concepts so it was great to be able to practice them during this project.
