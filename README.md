<b>Tech Used:</b> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

<b>What I Learned</b>: This task presented me a lot of problems at first. The biggest issue I faced was linking my photos from my HTML to my JavaScript. It is amazing what .src can do. Another thing was the execution flow of the function. During this project it really instilled in me that the order you write your function in, is the order that you want things to happen in. Also, not everything needs to go inside the function!! Overall, it was tough but I am so proud of how this one turned out!
