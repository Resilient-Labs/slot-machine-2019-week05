# ðŸŽ° Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Slot Machine

### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

<p>Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update</p>

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>The HTML and CSS was simple enough; classic &lt;button&gt; inputs (for clearing values and betting money) with a &lt;select&gt; drop down showing the user price values ($5, $10, $20, $50, $100).</li>
  <li>The CSS was given a simple layout to mimic a slot machine.</li>
  <li>The JavaScript behavior was more time intensive, I had to create a function that used math (random values ranging from 1 to 5) to fill each of the slot machine slots (reel1, reel2, reel3) with (x, y, z) for each slot respectively.</li>  
  <li>This would then set the image on the HTML to display an emoji depending on the outcome; jackpot if all three are the same--hit again if else.</li>
  <li>The user's total (starting with $500) would be either added to or subtracted from based on the chosen dollar amount to bet.</li>
  <li>I also implemented a function that would alert(BANKRUPT--NO MONEY ON YOUR CARD) if the user's total was $0 or the user tried to bet with more money than the total.
  <li>Lastly, I gave the machine the option to clear itself so the values were reset.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, I am proud of this project because most of the brain power on this one was mine (with a touch of help from a dear friend).  JavaScript,  and well, functions as a whole, really, are not my strong suits, so the fact I actually figured this one out was impressive.  Go me.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: 5</li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: 4</li>
