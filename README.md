# How It's Made 
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript to build this project. It takes an input from the user in HTML. 
The Javascript is set up to take the input from the DOM. Then the button within the DOM will take the
behaviour from the javascript. Randomize the slot reels and give a value to what the user landed on 
within the machine. 

# What I learned 

This project taught me many different things about javascript. I learned that javascript can read
directory paths and can pull data from them. This could be pictures, videos, etc. I also learned
about using conditional statements and how much they can change your code for specific instances.
