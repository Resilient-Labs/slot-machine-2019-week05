## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations:
I improved the user experience by first checking they have placed a bet and have sufficient balance before beginning the game. I added a time out to the game result to enhance the excitement of gameplay. 

## Lessons Learned:
This project was a fun and exciting chance to flex my JavaScript muscles in new ways. I challenged myself while creating this project by using the forEach method and by using an array for the first time. I placed a strong emphasis on refactoring this project to increase precision and making use of new methods and operators.  I look forward to bringing the workflow and structure of this project into future applications.
