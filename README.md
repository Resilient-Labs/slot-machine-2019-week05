Lesson Learned:

This is one of my first html css projects. To this project I learned how to make a slot machine work by assigned variables to the images and using Math.random to randomize the image shown when the spin button is used. Here I used an event listener to detect the click, and also used conditionals to show messages, using innerText to refer to a certain area of the html, of when the player wins or loses.   

Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4

```
