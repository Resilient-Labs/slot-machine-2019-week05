## How It's Made:

## Tech Used: HTML, CSS &  Javascript

It was a great experience using functions that interacted with each other to not only spin a reel but to identify whether or not the images were the same. Also I added a special jackpot for when watermelons were the jackpot.

## Lessons Learned:

Writing javascript can be fun but is extremely challenging when efficiency is the goal. Would like to work on learning how to get the same product but with different solutions.
