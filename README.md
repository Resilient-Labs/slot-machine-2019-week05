# ðŸŽ° Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Slot Machine

### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update


I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 5

In this project I created a slot machine that randomizes between 5 images and three possible options at a time. I will come back to this project to tidy up some of the images to make sure they are centered correctly. Also, an alert was added when the user runs out of money to play the game.
