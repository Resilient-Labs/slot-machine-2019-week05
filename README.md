## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.
I started this project by building a function that would pull three random numbers then check if they'd match. Next, were conditionals that returned values based on that match. 3 in a row won the game while anything else lost. With those up I focused on creating statements to update the wallet amount with bets. Finally, I created a function to show the slot images from a sprite based on those random numbers. Throughout the process I used console.log to check if functions were giving the values I expected and work out bugs.

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first time spriting an image, it took a bit to get right and was a highlight moment. I also learned to use the DOM inner text as a value for statements in HTML that could then be returned as a new value. Learning even more about just how many ways the DOM could be manipulated was exciting. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
