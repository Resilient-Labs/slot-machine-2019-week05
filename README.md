## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

So I started by making array. Then I put all my slot sections, bet amounts, buttons and wallet in different variables then set them equal to document.querySelector and their respective corresponding html tags. I then put all of the slots into a function and had them equal to images with an array attached that had the get random index method. I then added a check win function to give you money if you win or keep the money if you lose.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that it is easierto put elements and tags that you will be working with in a variable so you can reference them with variables rather then having to do document.querySelector everytime you want to reference the same tag over and over again.
