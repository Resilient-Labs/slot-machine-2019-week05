# ðŸŽ° Slot Machine Project

This project is mimicking a slot machine using JavaScript that you would play at a real-life casino. you can choose a minimum bet of $5 or maximum bet of $50 to test your luck. If you match all 3 numbers in each reel, you wil $50.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I first created the HTML for the content of the site - and to have places for each real, the min/max buttons, as well as the total amount of money. Afterwards, I used JavaScript to generate random numbers from 1-5 for each real, and functions that excute when you click the mix/max numbers. using conditionals, I mde it so that if all 3 reel numbers are equal to one another, you would get an additional $50 to your total amount. If not, you would be deducted the amount you bet. Additionally, I made sure that if you have no more money (0), you can not longer play the game. I then used CSS to give it a darker theme with brighter colors that stand out. 

## Lessons Learned:

This was great JavaScript practice, so after completeing this I am trying to continue to memorize the patterns used to make this project run, by deleting the code and doing it again off of memory. This definitely helped with my overll understanding of conditionals and functions as well.
