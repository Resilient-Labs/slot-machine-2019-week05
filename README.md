# My Project
I collaborated with a group of 3 other people to construct a slot machine. The slot machine has 3 reels with 5 choices. The user starts with $1000 total and can only bet $5 or $50. A match of 3 of the same choices is a win and the user earns 10X their betting money. No matches equals a loss of their bet from their total.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Our team had several ideas to begin with. We started off with writing pseudo code to figure out what syntax to use to layout the different processes between the user and the game. At the core the game is a handful of functions that are connected to a button which activates the reels. The functions randomize the choices, check if the choices are a match, and subtract or add money to the bet.

## Lessons Learned:

This was really fun for me. I learned more about return statements, conditionals, and function calls. I am always fascinated how you can call a function within a function, within a variable or even another function call! :heart_eyes:
