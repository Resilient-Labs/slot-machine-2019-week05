### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This slot machine game uses 5 unique images. The user must get 3 of the same image in order to win stars. In order to organize and randomize the images that become the output, I used an array and the Math.floor() and Math.random() methods. 

### Lesson Learned

I learned to be mindful of edge cases and unintended effects that can be a result of my code. For example, in the form's input, the user is able to press the 'Enter key.' If they do this, the page will refresh. I did not want this to happen. Rather, when the 'Enter' key is pressed, I wanted the game function to run using the input that the user specified. In order to do this, I used the preventDefault() method and called the function that performs the game.
