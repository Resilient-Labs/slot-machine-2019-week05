How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Built a simple slot machine with 7 items per reel and 3 reels - user is able to insert how much money to spend then bet min or max and have their total update. Machine will also tell you if you win and how much!


This was really fun to me because my grandmother loves the casino and is always playing slot machines so being able to show her this put the biggest smile on her face.


Bottom-line:
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
Want to go back and update it with spin annimation and sound. Also would like to add a spin and stop button. Maybe use pictures instead of numbers.
