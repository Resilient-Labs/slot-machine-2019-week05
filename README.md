# 🎰 Week05 Project: Slot Machine 💌

Live Code: https://kimflores-slotmachine.netlify.app

# How It's Made:
### Tech used: 
**HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. 

Wrote up pseudo code and had to think about the layout of the HTML and how it would interact with the JS. Selected variables from the HTML, from there were able to reference them to the main function in the JS.

# Lessons Learned:
Organization and writing comments within my code helped me to have a better understanding of all the moving parts within the JS. I noticed how Math.floor() and Math.random() together are very powerful and provided me with the aid I needed to randomize the images in the reel array. During that process, I also learned how to apply an array of images from JS to the DOM.  


# Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
