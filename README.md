### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update


I built a slot machine using just HTML,CSS and Javascript.

This project involved using Javascript to manipluate the dom and make the website interactive. 

This website is reponsive on all devices.

My next goal for this project to is to update the CSS and match it to some virtual slot machines we see online!
