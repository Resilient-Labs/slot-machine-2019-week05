# Slot Machine: Javascript - Week 5
## Project done in two days. Check it out.

I made this cool slot machine just by learning JavaScript in 2 days. This slot machine keeps track of the user's score and whenever the user is losing or going to lose all the money, the page has an alert.

Instructions: Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update aka how much money they have won or lost. Min bet does $5 and Max bet does $50. They should start with $1000. Matches of the three wheels = a win just like a normal slot machine and they win 10x their bet.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6


I created global variables, so I can use them later in the functions. The buttons activate the functions where the computer gets random numbers, this random numbers are later used in a function that gets the random items. Conditionals are then used to see if the user won or lost. Based on the situation the DOM gets manipulated by increasing or decreasing the player's code. My code is understandable, concise and clean. I also used pure functions whenever they were possible.

Optimizations

I added some media queries to make it responsive in any device.

Lessons Learned:

Learning how to use the operators, random number functions and the DOM manipulation in the increasing or decreasing of numbers in the DOM was the major challenge, and I accomplished it.


This was my first project in week 5 in which I created everything from scratch, and by everything I mean HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. No templates or imported code were used. This made me realized how important it is JavaScript in the daily life of a user. With this in mind, I learned that when starting in JavaScript bugs could be a common thing, and that's why I created this code in a clean and understandable way, so I can recognize and fix the bugs. Take a look, and enjoy the Minecraft thing. I hope you like the project the same way I did when I was creating it!
