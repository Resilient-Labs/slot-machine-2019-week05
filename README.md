## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

This one was kinda fun to make. I learned how to make alerts when people don't have enough bets, or if they don't put in a bet. I also learned how to use Math.random to have the slot choices be randomized! I will say, working and understanding how to do the balances was a bit tough.
