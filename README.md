How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

I was able to create this simple slot machine by creating 2 functions for each bet allowed.
This slot machine allows you to bet on a minimum and maximum number to receive either a gain or loss of the bets chosen.
There are 3 reels with 5 items each, 5 possibilites of vacation destinations: Colombia, Italy, Japan, Thailand, and Turkey
