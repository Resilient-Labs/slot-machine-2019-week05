## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First I used HTML to create 4 sections. 3 of them are assigned to the reels and the 4th section is used to contain the buttons and the total amount for the user. Next I used JavaScript to create the functionaility of how the game operates. Next, I used CSS to style the game to give it a more friendly user experience.

## Lessons Learned:
you can return a function in another function by assigning a variable to the original function name.
I also learned that you can multiply math.random by a number to increase the range above 0-1.
