### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update


I built a slot machine using just HTML,CSS and Javascript.

This project involved using Javascript to manipluate the dom and make the website interactive.

I used grid and flexbox to make this website reponsive on all devices.

My next goal for this project to is make the actual slot machine animations work with spinning images.
