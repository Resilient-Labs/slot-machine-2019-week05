# ðŸŽ° Week05 Bootcamp2020 Project: Slot Machine

This slot machine allows the user to push two buttons and place different amounts of bets. The push of the button triggers the 3 slots to randomize the images. It allows the user to track how much money they have left and adds the amount when they win. This project is a fun side game for users to play created using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
