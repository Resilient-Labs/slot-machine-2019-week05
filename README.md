### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update


I built a slot machine using just HTML,CSS and Javascript.

This project involved using Javascript to manipluate the dom and make the website interactive. 

This website is reponsive on all devices.

My next goal for this project to is to update the CSS and match it to some virtual slot machines we see online!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

Money Shores Slot Machine was a great way to apply some fundamental JavaScript concepts like variables, functions, and conditional statements. 

## Optimizations

The CSS could definitely be changed a bit and I look to do this in the future! 

## Reflections:

This was a fun project to create and test out! I personally took to conditionals more than some other concepts so it was great to be able to practice them during this project.
