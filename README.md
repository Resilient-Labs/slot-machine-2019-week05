# Slot Machine
This is a project for creating a slot machine. You start of with $1000 credits. you press the betting buttons to bet either $5 or $50. if you win, you win 10X your initial bet and it will get added to your total credits. there is a prompt telling you if you win or lose for every bet.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To make this slot machine we make three sections for our slots. each slot is going to need to output 5 reel items randomly. to do this we create a mathematical function that outputs exactly 5 answers and insert them into our slots. since the results are binary for win/lose we can use an if else statement for winning and losing.  we need to update our totals after every bet is placed as well. we also need to let the user know if they won or not with a prompt. 

## Optimizations


## Lessons Learned:

Some great takeaways from this project are reusing your code. Both buttons do exactly the same thing. The only difference is quantity which can be easily changes. adding more betting options would only take a few minute.
