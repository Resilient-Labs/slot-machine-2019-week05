## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The CSS is basic and the images need some adjusting. The DOM manipulation of the reel pictures was most difficult and took time to have the images display.

## Lessons Learned
It was difficult to try to get the reels to work separately and getting them to work together using comparison operators to determine if there is a winner as well as the amount won. It was interesting seeing how others did their projects and to see how there is more than one way to do it.
