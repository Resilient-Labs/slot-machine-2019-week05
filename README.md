 This is a slot machine app made with a Super Mario theme to reminisce of old-school Mario minigames!

## How It's Made:
### Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

This is a slot machine app made with 3 reels, 5 items, a minimum bet of $% and a maximum bet of $50. The user presses the button corresponding to the bet they want to make, and if they line up three of the same item they get their bet back * 10, if not, they lose. If the remaining money count hits $0, the user will get alerted to stop because they're out of money. Likewise, if the remaining money count hits a negative number, the user will get alerted that they are now in debt, as a negative amount means they owe money.

This project is fully responsive and uses HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript as its languages.


## What I Learned:
In this project I learned a way to utilize arrays for randomization in JavaScript, and how to accommodate images to always appear in a set place no matter the device width.
