<h1> Slot Machine</h1>

<p>The slot machine that I created allows the user to start with $1000. The user can then select if they want to play with a minimum bet of $5 or a maximum bet of $50. If the user wins and displays three of the same images then 10x the bet will be added to the ammount of money left.</p>

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<span>Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>

<p>To begin making this project I psedo coded what the user needed to see which included three (3) buttons. My first focused was getting the buttons to work properly which included assigning event listeners as well as making sure the buttons were adding and subtracting properly. Next I used the math.random function to generate random numbers for when the user utilzatizes the spin button. I then assigned images to each random number. </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p> This lesson showed me the importance of psuedo code. Being relatively new to software engineering often times looking at the whole project can be overwhelming. Once I broke everything down to smalller parts and focused soley on getting those parts to work, the project began coming together.</p>
