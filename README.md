# ðŸŽ° Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Slot Machine

### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update

Definitely a project I'll remember as it had to do with one of the best animes ever written! This Attack On Titan inspired slot machine allows the user to interact with a button that will randomly generate 3 images. If these images come out to be the same, the user will recieve a prize and can continue playing until they reach 0. Tougher than our last one but in my opinion way more aesthetically pleasing than the last one! I got to understand how to use randomness on a button press/interaction and how to continue adding/subtracting values based on the result the user sees! I'd love for you to try your luck so feel free to download my code and I hope you can become the next Attack Titan ready to defend Paradis Island!
