This project is a simple slot machine with 5 images, and 3 reels, and there should be a min or max with a total update as well. I decided to make buttons for amount's of money instead of min, max, with a balance that will provide the user with an update. 

The only downfall, I would say I had was when clicking on the money buttons, it didn't have a set amount where it would stop so it can reset. I am going to back and fix it, once I do research and learn how to fix it. 


I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if its okay that I didn't have a min or max button
