# ðŸŽ° Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Slot Machine

### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update


I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...

<h2>Slot Macchine Project</h2>
This is my project Slot machine Project I choose the theme of Yu-Gi-Oh and made my slots cards and each slot has access to 16 different images. You can bet between 1 to 50 dollars, and one thing that I would like to fix is for the user to get actual points. However because I have so many images it makes it near impossible to get any hits.

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<strong>Tech used:</strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
At first I apporached this project through a very simple way of 'Oh I'm just making a casino slot machine'. But I decided halfway through making that version, I wasn't really into it and scrapped the whole thing and started this version of the slot machine. I'm actually very proud of this and was able to gain assitance on certain aspects of it that stumped me.

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
I learned how to put images in javascript and how to effectively call on them as well when programming. 

<h2>Examples:</h2>
