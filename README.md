**Languages used:** Html, CSS, Javascript

# What I Learned
I learned how to use `Math objects` in the DOM to manipulate the slots and what they show. The use of conditionals were key and one of the more important pieces to my code in my functions. They helped me tackle some errors that break my code. 
I learned the difference between `global` and `local` variables and how to apply them throughout the code.

With CSS I learned `box-shadow` property and how they are used to style my elements to create actual buttons and have fun with the borders of my sections.
