<h1>Slot Machine</h1>

I created a fun slot machine. Even though it looks nice and clean it is very difficult to win.

<h2> How it's made</h2>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

I created multiple click events for each of my buttons on the slot machine. The spin button had a function that takes in numbers from another function that runs the Math.random() call. Running numbers from 1-5. depending on the number it will decide what image to display. If all 3 numbers match after clicking the Spin button it will display to the user they have won and the reward is 3 times what they bet.

<h2> Lesson Learned</h2>

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
