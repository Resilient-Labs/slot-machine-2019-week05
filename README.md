## Retro Machine

Play the slots on this retro machine. Place your bet of $5 or $50; if you win, you'll receive 10 times your bet, lose and you'll lose the amount of your bet. If your balance goes down to zero, it's game over.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Javascript is at the core of this project. Implementation of the retro machine uses functional programming. You place a bet, of either $5 or $50, and the algorithm randomizes options 1-5 within the three reels. A conditional statement then compares the value of the three slots. Matching values in all three slots results in an increase of 10 times your bet. Otherwise, the dollar amount in your wallet decreases by the amount of your bet.
